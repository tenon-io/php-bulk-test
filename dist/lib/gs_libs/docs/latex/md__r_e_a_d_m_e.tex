\subsection*{About gs\-\_\-libs}

This is a P\-H\-P library for use in creating C\-R\-U\-D interfaces with a database backend. I've been using this library for years, skipping out on the major frameworks mostly because my projects aren't that big and because a lot of this was written before most frameworks even existed.

Over the years I've cleaned up a lot of things, moved things around and made stuff better. I\-M\-O the forms class and the database classes are excellent. The forms class creates accessible forms with minimal effort.

\subsection*{Known issues}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There's a bit of code smell here and there. Many of the methods in the forms class allow far more parameters than what's considered best practice
\item Loads of methods use deprecated ereg\-\_\-$\ast$ functions and need to be updated
\item No unit tests exist for any of this.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item Go for it. Fork it, fix it, and issue your P\-Rs.
